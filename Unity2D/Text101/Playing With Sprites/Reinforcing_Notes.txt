What is a Sprite? A Sprite is a 2D graphic object obtained from a bitmap image.
It's a game aspect/element. They are the building blocks for the games we'll be working on.

Everything in hierarchy is a game object.
Double click on game object to go directly to it.
The hierarchy contains instances of objects (a copy).

By default, objects go on the zero x-axis, can toggle between 2D and 3D.
in 3D, moving is like in cinema 4D
